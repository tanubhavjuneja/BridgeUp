# Event Sponsorship Portal

This platform connects event organizers with sponsors to help fund and support events happening in the city. Sponsors can browse through various events and offer funding, while event organizers can find sponsors who are interested in supporting their events.

## Features

- **For Sponsors:**
  - Browse through events happening in the city.
  - Explore event details like budget requirements, expected crowd, and more.
  - Contact event organizers directly to offer sponsorship.

- **For Event Organizers:**
  - List events on the platform to attract sponsors.
  - Set event details like budget, crowd size, and sponsorship requirements.
  - Communicate with potential sponsors through the platform.

## How It Works

- **Sponsors** sign up and create profiles with details like their company name and contact information. They can then search for events that fit their budget and interests.
  
- **Event Organizers** create and manage their events, setting requirements for sponsorship. They can browse through available sponsors and reach out for potential partnerships.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Built using React to provide an interactive and responsive user experience.
- **Backend**: A server-side component (Node.js or Python) handles the event and sponsor data, authentication, and communication between organizers and sponsors.
- **Database**: MySQL stores user profiles, event details, and sponsor information.
